### When creating or consuming an API, the following key considerations ensure security and reliability:

1. `Authentication & Authorization:` JWT (JSON Web Token): Use token-based authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access your API.
OAuth: If the API is public, consider OAuth for third-party access control.

2. `HTTPS (Secure Transfer Protocol)` Always use HTTPS to secure connections between clients and servers, ensure data privacy, and prevent middleman attacks.

3. `Error handling` Make sure your API handles errors nicely without leaking important information. Provide reasonable error messages (e.g., 400 bad request, 404 not found)

5. `Encryption` Use HTTPS to encrypt data while itâ€™s being sent, making it safe from being read or stolen.
